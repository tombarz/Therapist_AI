H: Hi Catherine, thank you for
taking the time to come and
meet with me today.
C: Hi:
H: Just before we get started I
just want to go over a few
things regarding
confidentiality with you and
make sure that we discuss a
little bit about the counselling
relationship.
C: ok
H: The information that you
share with me and any notes
that I might take during a
counselling session are kept
completely confidential.
C: ok
H: However, there may be
specific situations where I may
need to break confidentiality.
That is if you tell me that you
may be of harm to yourself or
to others or if you tell me that
you’ve been involved in a
serious crime or if the
information is requested with a
subpoena during legal
proceedings. So in those
situations I would be required
to share the information that we
discuss. Do you have any
questions about any of this so
far?
C: No I don’t think so.
H: Ok then we’ll just get
started, so firstly thanks for
coming in today, it’s nice to
meet you. Is there a specific
reason for your visit?
C: Yes, I’m here because about 6 weeks ago I was in a really
bad car accident.
H: Oh dear, I’m really sorry to
hear that.
C: Ya, I was driving along the
highway, it was late at night I
was on my way home from a
friends house and it was raining
pretty hard and I just ended up
loosing control of my car, it
spun around and I ended up
upside down in my car in the
other lane.
H: Wow, that must have been
extremely scary for you.
C: Yes, it was pretty crazy,
definitely scary.
H: Can you tell me a little more
about what happened?
C: Yes, luckily I had my phone
in my pocket and I was able to
get it and call 911. But I was so
out of it I hung up before I even
told them where I was or how
seriously I needed help.
H: Yes you were
understandably in a state of
shock in that moment; it’s
commendable that you were
able to manage the call at all.
C: Luckily there was a truck
driving behind me who saw the
whole thing and he ended up
stopping traffic and calling 911.
The firefighters needed to use
the Jaws of Life to get me out
of my car.
H: Wow. So, it sounds like it
was a very serious accident.
C: Yes it was, I could have
been very badly hurt, or worse,
have lost my life. But luckily
there was someone there who
helped me.
H: Wow, that must have been
very frightening. And I notice
that you’re feeling a great deal
of gratitude towards the person
that was able to help you.
C: Ya I am, it could have been
so bad it was terrifying; I had
never experienced something
where I was so out of control
like that.
H: Yes, many people would
perceive a car accident as being
a very traumatic event.
Sometimes even just witnessing
a car accident can be very
stressful.
C: Mmhmm
H: So how has your recovery
been since the accident six
weeks ago?
C: Well, it’s been really hard.
Even though the doctors say
that there’s nothing wrong with
me, no broken bones, nothing
physical, I really just don’t feel
like myself.
H: Right, in what way do you
feel different than from before
the accident?
C: I’ve just been kind of tired.
Like I want to sleep a lot. I
don’t feel like going out.
H: That is understandable;
you’ve been through a very
frightening experience. I want
you to know that I’ve
experienced a similar thing in
my life, so I do understand that
it is really challenging, but I
want to help you get through it.
C: Hmm ok.
H: So since the accident, you
just haven’t been feeling like
yourself, you’ve been feeling
tired and down. Can you tell me
a little more about that?
C: Ya, so I’ve just been really
scared to drive anywhere by
myself mostly. I haven’t been
wanting to go to work because
I’m scared to do the drive in the
morning and during rush hour
on the way home and I’ve been
avoiding seeing my friends
because I will only hang out
with them if they’ll drive over
to my house.
H: I know that takes a lot of
strength, even just driving to
work. And I can hear how that
has really affected you, and
how difficult it is to get into a
car after being in an accident.
So this is causing you to avoid
spending time with your
friends.
C: It is, ya I’m definitely not
going to get into the car to go
and see my friends, so I’m
really not doing anything
anymore, and I bet they just
think that’s kind of pathetic,
like it was over a month ago
now, they think I should just
get over it. It seems like I
should just get over it by now,
but I’m not. So I’m feeling
pretty down about it.
H: So you’re feeling upset that
you aren’t back to your normal
self yet.
C: Yes
H: And you think that your
friends don’t really understand
or value the extent of what
you’ve been through.
C: Ya I don’t know they
haven’t really said that I should
be over it by now, but you can
just tell by like the little
comments and the way my
husband is trying to push me to
start driving again.
H: Right, so you’re feeling a lot
of pressure to be able to drive
again but you’re not feeling
quite ready yet.
C: Ya and it’s making me
depressed because I’m not
seeing my friends, I’m not
living up to what I was once
able to do. And then on top of
that I’m not doing any exercise
because I usually drive to my
gym and I’m not going out for
dinner with my friends and my
husband is making comments
like “you’ll be ok” “you used to
love driving” like just get back
on the horse right, but I don’t
really feel motivated try.
H: Right, so it’s affecting your
social interactions and your
relationships, and it sounds like
it’s affecting your beliefs about
yourself as well, having kind of
a negative self-talk and inner
dialogue.
C: Yeah, I mean I’ve always
kind of considered myself to be
a pretty strong person, I’ve
always been pretty independent,
usually I do a pretty good job at
handling situations and I think I
should be able to get over this
but I just can’t. I get so stressed
when I have to drive to work,
I’m sweating, my heart is
racing and I have difficult time
breathing. I just have this fear
that I’m going to die in another
accident.
H: Right that is understandable,
you’re experiencing a lot of
anxiety, and that is a very
typical fear response for
someone who has been through
what you’ve been through.
C: Ya I guess so.
H: And it’s very difficult when
you experience all those
physical symptoms, like a
racing heart, shortness of
breath, that can be very
stressful for you.
C: Yes, just makes me so
nervous, when I used to be fine
with driving
H: It sounds like you’re just
feeling a little unsure about
yourself right now, a little bit of
a lack of self confidence that
you once had
C: right
H: and this is causing you to
have doubts in yourself like
“what’s wrong with me” why
can’t I get over this.
C: yea exactly, like I just feel
like I should be ok by now.
H:Mmhhhm, so lots of feelings
of “I should” be able to cope
and “I should” be back to
normal
C: Yes because I didn’t get
seriously hurt, I wasn’t even
really injured, but now I’m just
so nervous about driving and
it’s making me miss out on the
things that I used to enjoy
doing.
H: Right, so the fact that you’ve
been avoiding driving means
that you’re not participating in
things that you think make you
feel good, like being with your
friends.
C: Ya and just having the
independence to go places and
get things done. Like now my
husband is doing the grocery
shopping after work because I
don’t want to drive anywhere.
But then this makes me feel bad
because I’m like not being
helpful anymore and I’m not
doing anything. Instead of
grocery shopping or exercising
or meeting up with friends I
just come home and sometimes
I’ll like take a nap or just watch
TV because I just don’t want to
go out and do anything.
H: Right, so the feelings of
anxiety and the fact that you
don’t want to be driving is
leading you to feel down about
not doing all the things that you
did before the accident.
C: right
H: But it’s amazing that you are
making it to work, so that’s
really impressive and clearly
demonstrates your strength.
C: Ya, I guess I just don’t really
have a choice, so I just force
myself even though I’m really
nervous the whole time.
H: So if you could kind of
imagine yourself, maybe three
months down the road, what
would you like to be feeling
and thinking?
C: I think that I want to feel
confident in my ability to drive
and also just my ability to get
through this.
H: Ok. What else do you
envision for the end of
counselling?
C: Just to feel more
comfortable driving, and be
able to drive to the gym, or just
drive to go and see friends.
H: Right.
C: And then just feeling better
about myself.
H: So your goals are to feel
significantly more comfortable
and confident with driving
again in comparison to how
you’re feeling at the moment.
C: Yes definitely.
H: And then also with that you
want to be able to do the every
day things that you were used
to doing before the accident.
C: Yes.
H: Ok, yes I can tell that it is
important for you to keep
seeing your friends and doing
the activities you enjoy as well
as helping out with day-to-day
errands.
C: Right
H: All these things contribute to
your feelings of happiness and
create a positive mood and help
combat those feelings of being
depressed as you said you were
feeling.
C: Ya
H: And then with this
confidence, and just feeling like
you can get through this you’d
be saying to yourself “I am
strong” “I can handle this” and
then that is going to affect how
you behave, and you will be
able to go out and go to your
regular activities.
C: Right,
H: So looking at some of your
goals, like feeling more
comfortable and being able to
go to friends, what might be a
small step you could take in
order to reach those goals?
C: I don’t know... I guess now
I’m just driving to work right
now and then I come straight
home. So I don’t know like I
don’t really want to drive
anywhere else.
H: Ok, thank you for being
honest.
C: Ya I just don’t know if I can
do it. I just get so nervous.
H: Right, and that is very
understandable. You mentioned
the grocery store, and that kind
of affecting your mood,
because you usually do the
grocery shopping?
C: Ya I just feel bad because I
feel so stressed I’ll avoid
driving even if it’s just to the
store.
H: Do you think you might be
able to try some very simple
breathing exercises, and some
mindfulness practices that help
to reduce the feelings of anxiety
when you get into the car.
C: Ya, definitely.
H: Great, I can tell you’re really
motivated and demonstrating a
lot of strength and a positive
attitude towards wanting to
achieve your goals.
C: Ya.
H: So maybe if you’re feeling a
little calmer when you were
driving home, do you think you
could stop at a store that is
along your way on your drive
home from work?
C: Ya I think so... like I could
go to a grocery store that’s
close to my house and so I
would almost be home and I
guess since I’m already in the
car anyways and it’s right along
the way.
H: Right, ya. So you’re already
in the car because you have to
drive home from work, and
then along the way you stop at
a grocery store and then
perhaps we could gradually
work our way up to driving to
different locations.
C: Yea I guess I could start
with something that is right
along the route of where I drive
to work and then go from there.
H: You have made a lot of
progress already, at the
beginning of the session you
mentioned that you weren’t
feeling motivated.
C: Ya that’s right.
H: But you’re here and you’re
talking to me about wanting to
get better and more comfortable
with driving again.
C: Ya that’s right.
H: Well I think that’s a really
good place to get started and
things might not progress
perfectly, but you have a very
good attitude especially
considering what you’ve
experienced so thank you for
coming here today.
C: Thank you
H: Great thanks Catherine, I
look forward to continuing to
work with you and help you get
through this difficult time.
C: Thanks.
