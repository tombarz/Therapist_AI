# Therapist_AI
The paper in "Therapist AI.pdf" presents an approach to developing an interactive psychology therapist using the LLM Llama 2. The proposed therapist aims to engage users in treatment like conversations by generating responses that are not only contex- tually relevant but also empathic, questioning, and reflective. It should mimic a real therapist session. Leveraging the capabilities of Hug- ging Face’s version of Meta’s Llama 2, we demonstrate the potential of creating an AI- driven psychology therapist that can effectively understand and address users’ psychological concerns.
